As such, High Resolution Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also supports The National Map."}}

The metadata were imported and updated for display through The National Map at http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html Chip-level metadata are provided in HTML and XML format. Data were compressed utilizing IAS software. The compression was JPEG2000 Lossy Compressed. The file format created was .jp2.","purpose":"A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also supports The National Map."}}

The primary dynamic digital orthophoto is a 60 centimeter ground resolution, image cast to the customer specified projection and datum defined in the Spatial Reference Information section of this metadata document. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and ensure full coverage if the imagery is reprojected. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The digital ortho-ready image is formatted as a GeoTIFF image file with a separate FGDC compliant metadata file.\" An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. NOTE: Distribution of this imagery is limited to the National Geospatial Agency and all Federal partners. Data is not licensed, but is restricted to NGA and Federal partners.
